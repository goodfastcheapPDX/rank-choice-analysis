# Performance Optimization Strategy
*Portland RCV Election Analyzer - Performance Enhancement Plan*

## Executive Summary

Based on performance analysis of our current architecture, we've identified significant optimization opportunities that could deliver 10-100x performance improvements for coalition analysis and 5-10x improvements for overall API response times. The primary bottleneck is expensive self-joins on our `ballots_long` table (332,969 records) during coalition analysis.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Coalition Analysis**: Expensive self-joins on `ballots_long` for every pairwise analysis request
2. **Data Loading**: Repeated wide→long transformations on startup
3. **Query Patterns**: Real-time computation of complex metrics that could be precomputed
4. **Memory Usage**: Inefficient data types and lack of dictionary encoding
5. **Caching**: No intelligent caching layer for frequently accessed data

### Current Query Performance Issues
- Coalition pairwise analysis: ~2-5 seconds per request
- Network centrality calculations: ~1-3 seconds per candidate
- Supporter segmentation: ~1-2 seconds per candidate
- Vote flow analysis: ~3-8 seconds for full STV run

## Optimization Strategy Overview

The recommended approach follows a **precompute vs on-demand** philosophy:
- **Precompute**: Heavy analytical computations that rarely change
- **Keep On-Demand**: Light filtering, aggregations, and user-specific views

## Priority 1: High-Impact Quick Wins (Immediate - 1-2 weeks)

### 1.1 Precompute Coalition Data Pipeline ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: Massive (10-100x speed improvement for coalition analysis)
**Current Problem**: Coalition analysis runs expensive self-joins on 332K records every request
**Solution**: Create batch precomputation pipeline

**Implementation Details**:
- Create `scripts/precompute_data.py` batch job
- Generate precomputed tables:
  - `adjacent_pairs`: (candidate_1, candidate_2, shared_ballots, avg_distance, strong_votes, weak_votes)
  - `coalition_pairs`: Proximity-weighted coalition scores for all pairs
  - `candidate_metrics`: Vote counts, weighted scores, network centrality
  - `transfer_patterns`: Precomputed vote transfer matrices
- Modify coalition APIs to query precomputed tables instead of live joins
- Add `--precompute` flag to data processing pipeline

**Expected Results**:
- Coalition pair analysis: 2-5 seconds → 50-100ms
- Network data generation: 3-8 seconds → 200-500ms
- Coalition clustering: 5-10 seconds → 1-2 seconds

### 1.2 Optimize Data Types & Storage ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: High (memory reduction, faster I/O)
**Current Problem**: Using default DuckDB types, no dictionary encoding
**Solution**: 
- Dictionary-encode `candidate_id` (22 candidates + write-ins)
- Use INT8 for `rank_position` (1-6)
- Use INT16 for `BallotID` references where possible
- Implement Parquet export for precomputed data with compression

**Expected Results**:
- Memory usage: 50-70% reduction
- I/O performance: 30-50% faster
- Storage efficiency: 40-60% smaller files

### 1.3 Eliminate Repeated Wide→Long Transforms ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: High (avoid expensive UNPIVOT on every startup)
**Current Problem**: CVR parser rebuilds `ballots_long` dynamically from CVR headers
**Solution**:
- Persist `ballots_long` as permanent table after first load
- Add incremental update capability for new data files
- Create data versioning/cache invalidation system
- Implement data integrity checks

**Expected Results**:
- Application startup: 15-30 seconds → 2-5 seconds
- Data reload operations: 80% faster
- Reduced CPU usage during initialization

## Priority 2: Medium-Impact Optimizations (2-4 weeks)

### 2.1 Smart Caching Layer ⭐⭐⭐

- Cache precomputed analysis results by parameters (min_shared_ballots, min_strength)
- Implement cache warming for common queries
- Add cache invalidation on data updates
- Memory-efficient caching with size limits

**Implementation**:
- Use Python `functools.lru_cache` for function-level caching
- Implement Redis for distributed caching (future scalability)
- Cache warm-up script for common parameter combinations
- Cache hit/miss monitoring

### 2.2 Query Pattern Optimization ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: Medium (targeted performance gains)
**Current Problems**: 
- Coalition centrality recalculates network metrics per request
- Supporter segmentation runs complex grouping queries
- Round progression recalculates STV data

**Solution**:
- Precompute network centrality metrics (degree, strength, bridge scores)
- Cache supporter archetype classifications
- Use materialized views for complex aggregations
- Optimize SQL query patterns (avoid unnecessary JOINs)

### 2.3 API Response Optimization ⭐⭐⭐
**Impact**: Medium (better user experience)
**Solution**:

- Add pagination for coalition pairs API (/api/coalition/pairs/all)
- Compress JSON responses with gzip
- Add response time monitoring and alerting
- Implement partial data loading for progressive enhancement

## Priority 3: Advanced Optimizations (4-8 weeks)

### 3.1 Advanced Precomputation Engine ⭐⭐
**Impact**: Medium (enable more sophisticated analysis)
**Solution**:
- Precompute STV round progression data for all candidates
- Generate vote flow transfer matrices by round
- Create exhaustion pattern analysis by precinct/demographic
- Build precinct-level aggregations (when geographic data becomes available)
- Implement counterfactual scenario precomputation

### 3.2 Serving Model Optimization ⭐⭐
**Impact**: Medium (scalability and deployment efficiency)
**Solution**:
- Implement versioned data bundles in `election_id=.../` folder structure
- Static JSON slices for common API responses
- S3/cloud storage integration for large datasets
- CDN caching for static analysis results
- Optimized data serialization formats

**Folder Structure**:

### 3.3 Background Processing Pipeline ⭐⭐
**Impact**: Medium (operational efficiency and user experience)
**Solution**:
- Async data processing with background task queues
- Scheduled precomputation updates (daily/weekly)
- Progressive analysis loading (show basic data first, enhance progressively)
- Health monitoring for data pipeline
- Automated data validation and quality checks
