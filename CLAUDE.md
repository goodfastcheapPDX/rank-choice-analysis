# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a ranked-choice voting analysis project for analyzing election data from Portland City Council District 2 elections. The project currently contains Cast Vote Record (CVR) data in CSV format from ranked-choice voting elections.

## Data Structure

The repository contains election data files:
- CSV files with Cast Vote Records (CVR) format
- Each record contains ballot information with candidate rankings (1-6 ranks per candidate)
- Data includes 22 candidates plus write-in options for a multi-winner election (3 winners)

### CVR Data Format

The CSV files contain these key columns:
- `RowNumber`, `BoxID`, `BoxPosition`, `BallotID`: Ballot identification
- `PrecinctID`, `BallotStyleID`, `PrecinctStyleName`: Location information
- `Choice_X_1:City of Portland, Councilor, District 2:Y:Number of Winners 3:[Candidate Name]:NON`: Ranking data
  - X = Choice ID number (36-57, plus write-in IDs)
  - Y = Rank position (1-6)
  - Values are 1 for selected rank, 0 for not selected

## Data Analysis Considerations

When working with this election data:

1. **Multi-winner RCV**: This is a 3-winner ranked-choice election, requiring different tabulation algorithms than single-winner RCV
2. **Candidate Management**: 22 named candidates plus multiple write-in categories
3. **Ranking Structure**: Voters can rank up to 6 preferences per candidate
4. **Data Volume**: Files contain 50k+ ballot records for analysis

## Expected Development Tasks

Future development will likely involve:
- Data parsing and validation scripts
- RCV tabulation algorithms (likely Single Transferable Vote for multi-winner)
- Results visualization and reporting
- Data export/import utilities
- Statistical analysis tools

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with DuckDB for fast analytical queries
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI with Jinja2 templates
- **Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts
- **Data Storage**: Parquet/DuckDB for efficient querying
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

# Process CVR data (required first step)
python scripts/process_data.py your_file.csv --db election_data.db --validate

# Run STV tabulation
python scripts/run_stv.py --db election_data.db --seats 3 --export results

# Test the complete pipeline
python scripts/test_pipeline.py
```

### Web Application
```bash
# Start web server
python scripts/start_server.py --db election_data.db --port 8000

# Development mode with auto-reload
python scripts/start_server.py --db election_data.db --reload
```

### Package Management

## API Endpoints

The web application provides REST API endpoints:
- `GET /api/summary` - Summary statistics
- `GET /api/candidates` - Candidate list
- `GET /api/first-choice` - First choice results
- `GET /api/stv-results` - Run STV tabulation
- `GET /api/ballot/{ballot_id}` - Individual ballot details
- `GET /api/export/*` - CSV data exports

## File Naming Convention

Election data files follow pattern: `[Election_Description]_[Date].cvr.csv` or similar variations with sample indicators.

## Current Status Report

### ✅ **Phase 1 Complete: Basic Data Explorer**
- **Data Processing Pipeline**: ✅ Working
- **STV Tabulation Engine**: ✅ Working  
- **Web Interface**: ✅ Working
