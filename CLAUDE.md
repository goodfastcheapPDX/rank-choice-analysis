# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a ranked-choice voting analysis project for analyzing election data from Portland City Council District 2 elections. The project currently contains Cast Vote Record (CVR) data in CSV format from ranked-choice voting elections.

## Data Structure

The repository contains election data files:
- CSV files with Cast Vote Records (CVR) format
- Each record contains ballot information with candidate rankings (1-6 ranks per candidate)
- Data includes 22 candidates plus write-in options for a multi-winner election (3 winners)

### CVR Data Format

The CSV files contain these key columns:
- `RowNumber`, `BoxID`, `BoxPosition`, `BallotID`: Ballot identification
- `PrecinctID`, `BallotStyleID`, `PrecinctStyleName`: Location information
- `Choice_X_1:City of Portland, Councilor, District 2:Y:Number of Winners 3:[Candidate Name]:NON`: Ranking data
  - X = Choice ID number (36-57, plus write-in IDs)
  - Y = Rank position (1-6)
  - Values are 1 for selected rank, 0 for not selected

## Data Analysis Considerations

When working with this election data:

1. **Multi-winner RCV**: This is a 3-winner ranked-choice election, requiring different tabulation algorithms than single-winner RCV
2. **Candidate Management**: 22 named candidates plus multiple write-in categories
3. **Ranking Structure**: Voters can rank up to 6 preferences per candidate
4. **Data Volume**: Files contain 50k+ ballot records for analysis

## Expected Development Tasks

Future development will likely involve:
- Data parsing and validation scripts
- RCV tabulation algorithms (likely Single Transferable Vote for multi-winner)
- Results visualization and reporting
- Data export/import utilities
- Statistical analysis tools

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with DuckDB for fast analytical queries
- **Web Framework**: FastAPI with Jinja2 templates
- **Visualization**: Plotly.js for interactive charts
- **Data Storage**: Parquet/DuckDB for efficient querying
- **Dependencies**: See `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

- Lower priority for current use case
- Can be integrated into ballot explorer when implemented

#### **Educational STV Explainer** (Phase 5+)
- May not be needed if good external resources exist
- Only implement if specifically designed as application tutorial

### 🎯 **Current Goal**
Transform from "election insight engine" to "comprehensive candidate-centered analytics platform" that enables deep exploration of individual candidates, advanced metrics analysis, and sophisticated coalition understanding for researchers, candidates, and engaged voters.
