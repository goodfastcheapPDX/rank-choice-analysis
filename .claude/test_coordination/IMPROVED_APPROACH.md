# Improved Multi-Instance Coordination Approach

## Problem Identified
The tmux session was hidden from view - you couldn't see the secondary Claude instance's interactions.

## Better Approaches

### Approach 1: Split Terminal Workflow
1. **Current Terminal**: Keep this Claude session running
2. **Second Terminal**: You manually open and run:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ranked-elections-analyzer
   tmux new-session -s claude_secondary
   claude  # Start second Claude instance
   ```
3. **Coordination**: Use shared files for communication between instances

### Approach 2: Side-by-Side Monitoring
1. **Primary**: This Claude instance
2. **Secondary**: You launch in separate terminal/window
3. **Monitoring**: Use shared log file that both can tail:
   ```bash
   tail -f .claude/test_coordination/test_log.txt
   ```

### Approach 3: Step-by-Step Manual Coordination
Instead of automated polling, use explicit handoffs:
1. **Primary Claude**: Creates task file
2. **You**: Switch to secondary terminal, tell that Claude to process the task
3. **Secondary Claude**: Processes and creates response file
4. **You**: Switch back, tell primary Claude to read the response

## Recommended Next Test

### Setup
1. **This Claude session**: Handles primary coordination
2. **You open second terminal**:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/c/Users/Joe/Projects/ranked-elections-analyzer
   claude
   ```
3. **Both instances**: Use shared `.claude/coordination/` directory

### Workflow Test
1. **Primary**: "Create a research task file for the secondary instance"
2. **You**: Switch to secondary terminal
3. **Secondary**: "Check for and process any tasks in .claude/coordination/"
4. **You**: Switch back to primary terminal
5. **Primary**: "Check for results from secondary instance"

This gives you **full visibility** into both instances while testing the coordination mechanism.

## Want to Try This Approach?

I can:
1. Create a simple task/response protocol
2. Generate the first task file
3. Wait for you to set up the second Claude instance
4. Guide you through the coordination test

The key insight is that **manual coordination** might actually be more practical than fully automated coordination for most use cases.
